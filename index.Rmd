## Profile {data-icon="user"}

### Personal profile

N/A

N/A

N/A

I am an enthusiastic aspiring researcher that is passionate about solving
complex biological questions. To pursue this goal, I want to use new
computational tools and large-scale omics techniques. Currently developed omics
techniques allows us to answer exciting biological questions that were out of
reach not too long ago. Furthermore, I aspire to further develop my
skills in analyzing, visualizing and interpreting these large omics datasets,
which is helped by my extensive biological background.

## Recognition {data-icon="award"}

### Theme winner (Energy) Sustainable campus challenge 2020

Utrecht Challenge Alliance

Utrecht, The Netherlands

2020

<br>

I participated in the sustainable campus challenge 2020 organized by the Utrecht challenge alliance. This is a partnership for open innovation to find regional solutions to social issues in cooperation between companies, public organisations, governments and educational institutions. We were tasked to come up with a concept to reduce the energy usage of student housing and came up with a concept that rewards students for their sustainable behaviour. Our concept was chosen as the best concept to reduce student energy usage.
