## Recognition {data-icon="award"}

### Theme winner (Energy) Sustainable campus challenge 2020

Utrecht Challenge Alliance

Utrecht, The Netherlands

2020

<br>

I participated in the sustainable campus challenge 2020 organized by the Utrecht challenge alliance. This is a partnership for open innovation to find regional solutions to social issues in cooperation between companies, public organisations, governments and educational institutions. We were tasked to come up with a concept to reduce the energy usage of student housing and came up with a concept that rewards students for their sustainable behaviour. Our concept was chosen as the best concept to reduce student energy usage.

### Latin honors (Cum laude) for BSc in Biology
